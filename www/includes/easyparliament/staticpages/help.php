<dt><a name="moderation"></a>How do you moderate comments?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Ideally, we won't. If everyone keeps to the <a href="<?=WEBPATH?>houserules" title="link to House Rules">House Rules</a>, that is. But we're not naive enough to think that life online is that simple. OpenAustralia.org operates a 'reactive moderation' policy. We will only check whether a comment breaches our House Rules if someone lets us know of their concerns via the 'Report this Comment' link,  which can be found next to every comment. If we decide that the comment has breached our House Rules, we will delete it and let the original author know via email. We will also give them opportunity to rephrase and resubmit their orginal comment. If we deem the comment to be legit, we'll leave it up, and email the complainant to let them know why. We will do our utmost to respond to reports of potential breaches of our House Rules within forty-eight hours, but please bear in mind that this service is run by volunteers, and sometimes it might take us slightly longer.</p>

<dt><a name="missing"></a>Is this the whole of Hansard?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>Not quite. This is everything in the Hansard for the House of Representatives excluding written questions, petitions,
		the divisions (voting), and procedural text and so far goes back to the beginning of 2006. It also does not include committees. Think of what we've done
thus far as a mere taster of what could be possible. In the future we plan to add voting information, the Senate and committees too.
If you want the complete, definitive record, go to the <a href="http://aph.gov.au/" title="Link to Australian Parliament website">Australian Parliament</a> site, and you might be able to find what you want.</p>

<dd>
<p>We use Google Analytics to track aggregated traffic through the website. It captures nothing that you won't find in an Apache logfile, but has an interface we like, and is dead easy to use. Rest assured, we only track usage data for one reason only: to help us understand how we can make the site work better for you lot. If anyone wants to whinge about 'Web Bugs', expect short shrift. </p>

<dt><a name="rss"></a>What is RSS?</dt>
<dd>
<p>RSS files contain information about a list of things: diary entries, speeches, etc. and are formatted to be readable by computer programs, rather than humans. So what use are they? You can use a program called a news reader to store the locations of RSS feeds, and each time one is updated - with new diary entries or speeches - you can easily see what's new. It saves you visiting web pages on the off-chance anything new has appeared. Popular RSS readers are <a href="http://www.sharpreader.net/">Sharpreader</a> for Windows or <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/#lite">NetNewsWire Lite</a> for Macs. <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> is an online RSS reader.</p>

<dt><a name="votingrecord"></a>How is the voting record decided?</dt>
<dd>
<p>The voting record is not affected by what MPs and Peers have said, only how they
<strong>voted</strong> in relation to that topic in the house - i.e. "aye" or
"no".  Votes on each topic were examined, and strength of support determined
based on these votes.  Follow the "votes" link next to each topic for details.
Additionally, in many votes, MPs and Peers are told how to vote ('whipped') by their
parties. Since the Whip is secret, we have to assume, <a
href="http://www.openaustralia.org/debate/?id=2005-02-07.1200.2">like the
Speaker</a>, that all votes are free.  </P>

<dt><a name="numbers"></a>Why should I read in more depth than just the numbers?</dt>

<dd>
<p>A few people have asked why we publish statistics on how often Representatives use
alliterative phrases, such as "she sells seashells".
</p>

<p>Simply put, we realise that data such as the number of debates spoken in Parliament
means little in terms of a Representative's actual performance.  Representatives do lots of useful
things which we don't count yet, and some which we never could.  Even when we
do, a count doesn't measure the quality of a Representative's contribution.</p>

<p>On the UK site <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com">TheyWorkForYou</a>, they used to publish absolute rankings of, for
	instance, the most verbose MPs. Then, they were hearing from real MP's researchers who
	admitted to tabling questions to increase their boss' rankings. So, TheyWorkForYou
	became concerned about the use of these statistics</p>
	
<p> We've followed their lead by doing two things. We have silly statistics, to catch your attention.
And we don't have absolute rankings. Instead of saying a Representative is exactly
5th for giving out verbiage in the chamber, we just say that they are
"well above average". 

<p>Our advice &mdash; when you're judging your Representative, read some of their speeches,
check out their website, even go to a local meeting and ask them a question.
Use OpenAustralia as a gateway, rather than a simple place to find a number
measuring competence.

<p>If you have other suggestions for useful metrics, send them to the <a href="mailto:contact&#64;openaustralia.org">usual
address</a>. We have a few ideas ourselves to keep you on your toes.

<dt><a name="api"></a>Do you have the data as a spreadsheet file, XML or in an API?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Yes. If you just need a spreadsheet of
representatives, you'll find one on the right hand side of <a href="<?= WEBPATH ?>/mps">this page</a>.
Also, we will have an API (Application Programming Interface) soon which will give you the power to do almost anything with our data.
Please <a href="mailto:contact&#64;openaustralia.org">mail us</a> if you want help 
working out how to use the data, or want to hire us to make something specific
for you.
