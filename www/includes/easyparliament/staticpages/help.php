<dt><a name="moderation"></a>How Do You Moderate Comments?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Ideally, we won't. If everyone keeps to the <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/houserules/" title="link to House Rules">House Rules</a>, that is. But we're not naive enough to think that life online is that simple. TheyWorkForYou.com operates a 'reactive moderation' policy. We will only check whether a comment breaches our House Rules if someone lets us know of their concerns via the 'Report this Comment' link,  which can be found next to every comment. If we decide that the comment has breached our House Rules, we will delete it and let the original author know via email. We will also give them opportunity to rephrase and resubmit their orginal comment. If we deem the comment to be legit, we'll leave it up, and email the complainant to let them know why. We will do our utmost to respond to reports of potential breaches of our House Rules within forty-eight hours, but please bear in mind that this service is run by volunteers, and sometimes it might take us slightly longer.</p>

<dt><a name="missing"></a>Is this the whole of Hansard?</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is everything in the House of Commons Hansard,
back to the General Election of June 2001. It is also everything
in the House of Lords Hansard (except Grand Committees) back to around
November 1999.
But this is by no means everything. Think of what we've done
thus far as a mere taster of what could be possible.
In the future we plan to incorporate the
gems to be found in Parliamentary
Committees, where many MPs and Peers do good solid unheralded work improving
legislation. If
you want the complete, definitive record, go to the <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/" title="Link to parliament website">UK Parliament</a> site, and you might be able to find what you want.</p>

<dt><a name="extreme"></a>What's that weird 'urchin' javascript I spy in your page source?</dt>
<dd>
<p>We use Google Analytics to track aggregated traffic through the website. It captures nothing that you won't find in an Apache logfile, but has an interface we like, and is dead easy to use. Rest assured, we only track usage data for one reason only: to help us understand how we can make the site work better for you lot. If anyone wants to whinge about 'Web Bugs', expect short shrift. </p>

<dt><a name="rss"></a>What is RSS?</dt>
<dd>
<p>RSS files contain information about a list of things: diary entries, speeches, etc. and are formatted to be readable by computer programs, rather than humans. So what use are they? You can use a program called a news reader to store the locations of RSS feeds, and each time one is updated - with new diary entries or speeches - you can easily see what's new. It saves you visiting web pages on the off-chance anything new has appeared. Popular RSS readers are <a href="http://www.sharpreader.net/">Sharpreader</a> for Windows or <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/#lite">NetNewsWire Lite</a> for Macs. <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> is an online RSS reader.</p>

<dt><a name="votingrecord"></a>How is the voting record decided?</dt>
<dd>
<p>The voting record is not affected by what MPs and Peers have said, only how they
<strong>voted</strong> in relation to that topic in the house - i.e. "aye" or
"no".  Votes on each topic were examined, and strength of support determined
based on these votes.  Follow the "votes" link next to each topic for details.
Additionally, in many votes, MPs and Peers are told how to vote ('whipped') by their
parties. Since the Whip is secret, we have to assume, <a
href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debate/?id=2005-02-07.1200.2">like the
Speaker</a>, that all votes are free.  </P>
